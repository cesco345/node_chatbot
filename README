This is a ChatBot written in JavaScript and Node.js using the OpenAI API. It is based on Brad Traversy tutorial with a minor tweak and migration to a newer version to make the code work. For this reason if you are following his tutorial, I would advise to use the command **_ npm exec openai migrate _** to make the code work in newer ChatGPT updated versions.

Steps:
npm init
**_ give package information _**

npm install openai readline-sync optional dependencies: (dotenv colors)

Happy Hacking!
